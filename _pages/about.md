Hands-on experience
======
March 2024       School-level Programming Project             Design and Implementation of Intelligent Face Recognition Access Control System           Project Leader
------
Utilized the OpenCV image processing library to capture images and construct face data. Based on the MindSpore platform developed by Huawei, designed relevant face recognition algorithms using the dlib algorithm. Achieved real-time image capture and face recognition, created a simple UI interface, and controlled components such as MLX90614, servos, and passive buzzers using Raspberry Pi 4B and Arduino UNO development boards to implement the face recognition access control system.

November 2023       School-level Electronic Circuit Project Design         Design of a Digital Pulse Width Modulation Pulse Signal Generator           Project Leader
Utilized ISE Design to develop and create a pulse signal generator with adjustable pulse width, controlled by buttons, which can increase or decrease the duty cycle by 1% each time, displaying the duty cycle of the output pulse signal on a digital tube, and also showing the pulse width situation.

May 2023       School-level Open Experimental Project             Design and Implementation of a Laser Harp                   Main Participant
Designed and created a laser harp, programmed the microcontroller to control the production of different musical notes with laser beams and the display of LED lights, and it can play various music and adjust the volume.
